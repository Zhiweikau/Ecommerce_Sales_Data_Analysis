### Project Overview
Owner of Madhav Store wants us to help them create a dashboard to track and analyze their online sales across India. This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis of online sales data, leveraging SQL for robust data querying and manipulation. The analysis is complemented by advanced visualization by using Power BI.

### Objective
-	The objective of this project is to derive actionable insights related to sales transactions, customer behavior, and product performance across year 2018.
-	The analysis spans various dimensions, including temporal (monthly trends, purchase dates), geographical (state level analysis), and categorical aspects (product categories, sub-categories, and payment modes). 
-	By exploring these dimensions, the project aims to uncover patterns in sales performance, customer preferences, and profitability across different regions and product types, ultimately supporting data-driven decision-making.

### Data Source
